# Player Trackers

This Spigot plugin grants players the ability to craft
special items called _"trackers"_ that allow the player to
track down the location of the player (or inventory)
holding that item using the in-game compass.

The problem that this plugin solves is the difficulty of
finding other players bases in such a large world when
playing in small (or not so smalls) servers. This encourages
player interaction and avoids gameplay turning monotonous and boring.

## TODO
1. Track shulkers
2. Delete trackers without destroying item
